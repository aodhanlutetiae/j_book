Intro
============================

This is a collection of things useful for learning to produce journalism using data. A [reading list](https://dj-reading.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is held separately.

There are addresses and email subscriptions for monitoring data releases (generally by government or official bodies) under **Monitoring** and there are catalogues of datasets produced by media and other groups under **Collections**. There is a long multi-category list of datasets where we put links to interesting datasets and there are some jupyter notebooks with analyses done in Python.
