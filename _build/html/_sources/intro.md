Intro
============================

This is a collection of things that are useful for producing journalism with data. A [reading list](https://dj-reading.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is held separately.

There are addresses and email subscriptions for monitoring official data releases under **Monitoring** and there are catalogues of datasets produced by media and other groups under **Collections**.

Then there is a long multi-category list where I put links to interesting datasets, some Jupyter notebooks with analyses and some tools that have come out of newsrooms or news projects.
