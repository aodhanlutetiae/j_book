About
=====

I teach data journalism at Cardiff University's School of Journalism (Jomec). This material is sometimes used for undergraduate or postgraduate courses but mostly it's just an ongoing collection of data I find interesting.

You can reach me [on twitter](https://twitter.com/aodhanlutetiae) or by [email](mailto:aidan.odonnell@cardiff.ac.uk) with comments or questions.

This site runs on [jupyter {book}](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html)
