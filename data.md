Lists of datasets
=================

This section holds datasets.

The datasets here are not recommended over others (*Don't* use data just because you found it on somebody's list). These datasets are here because they're interesting and in places they illustrate the astonishing range of material that can be found.

You can search for words that appear in the description of the datasets with the search box on the left.

There is a lot of useful data here, but if you want something else track it down or build the dataset yourself.

A few of these have been brought to our attention by Jomec students who have used them for their reporting. So thank you!
